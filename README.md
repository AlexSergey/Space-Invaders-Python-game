# Space Invaders

I'm learning Python language now. For the test project I made the game from scratch.
I used PyGame Python framework and Python 2.7.
5 levels where implemented here you can see 3 types of enemies and the one Boss.
The types of enemies divided by AI and health set.
This game was create about 3 weeks by 3-4 hours in a day.
